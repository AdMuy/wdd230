    <h3>Site purpose:</h1>
      <p>
        The purpose of the site is giving an opportunity to the business, small and big from our local area, to get
        exposure to the potential clients <br>
        and strength our community. We know that is hard to make connections and with the rapid avance of technology we
        can lose many customers with a single click.<br>
        That's the reason why we have a dedicated directory with the most up-to-date information of our member
        businesses, we will also have a page dedicated<br>
        to any entrepreneur who wants to join our chamber and enjoy many benefits. <br>
        As our community is the most important part of this project, we also have a Discover page, where we can get to
        know more about our local area and <br>
        rich history we usually tend to forget. <br>
        Lastly, we will also have a dedicated page to Contact Us, there you will find more information about our current
        officers and send any feedback or question you may have.<br>
